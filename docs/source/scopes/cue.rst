Cue Marker and Range Metadata
------------------------------

Notes
=====

Cue metadata stores timed markers that clients use to mark times of interest
in a wave file, and optionally give them a name and longer comment. Markers 
can also have an associated length, allowing ranges of times in a file to be 
marked.
